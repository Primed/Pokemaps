    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=FD:B1:04:C4:6E:70:B5:F2:14:3E:E8:42:E1:A7:D2:1E:62:86:34:CF%3Bcom.genesys.pokemaps

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    FD:B1:04:C4:6E:70:B5:F2:14:3E:E8:42:E1:A7:D2:1E:62:86:34:CF;com.genesys.pokemaps

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
